## Patterns

### Session auth without Devise

Custom `Authentication` concern on `ApplicationController`; per-controller opt-out. Session id in a signed, httponly cookie. `Current` object via `ActiveSupport::CurrentAttributes` for request-scoped user/session.

Reference: Fizzy `app/controllers/concerns/authentication.rb`.

### `ActiveSupport::Concern` for shared model behavior

Extract repeated associations, scopes, and intent methods (`pin!`, `archive!`, etc.) into `app/models/concerns/`. Keep each concern focused on one behavior.

When the same verb means different things on different hosts, **namespace the concern** (`Model::Archivable`) instead of sharing one module with `after_*` hooks. Each namespaced concern owns its transaction and side effects.

Reference: Fizzy `app/models/concerns/`.

### Delegated types

`delegated_type :role` stores `role_type` + `role_id` on the parent; concrete types are normal models. Prefer over STI when subtypes differ substantially.

- API: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/DelegatedType.html
- Guide: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html

### Delegated types + nested attributes

Parent declares `accepts_nested_attributes_for :role`. Strong params permit `role_attributes` keyed by `role_type`. Each delegated class can expose its own permitted attribute list (class method on a shared concern) so the controller derives the permit shape from the submitted type.

- Nested attributes: https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods.html

### Action Text

`has_rich_text :content` stores HTML in `action_text_rich_texts`. Attachments (files or custom attachables) serialize as `<action-text-attachment>` nodes. Custom attachables implement `ActionText::Attachable` (`content_type`, `to_attachable_partial_path`, `attachable_sgid`).

Rich text saves on the `ActionText::RichText` record — hook `after_save` on that model (via `ActiveSupport.on_load(:action_text_rich_text)`) when logic must run only on body changes, not parent saves.

- Guide: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_text_overview.html
- Editor in this app: `docs/_lexxy.md`

### Active Storage direct uploads

Client uploads to storage via `DirectUpload`; the server receives a signed blob id. Intercept the editor's file-accept event when files should not become inline rich-text blobs.

- Guide: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_storage_overview.html#direct-uploads

### Request variants

`request.variant = :mobile` in a controller `before_action`; templates use the `+mobile.erb` suffix. Branch in shared templates with `request.variant.include?(:mobile)`.

- Guide: https://guides.rubyonrails.org/layouts_and_rendering.html#the-virtual-path-option

### Per-request timezone

Wrap actions in `Time.use_zone(zone) { yield }` where `zone` comes from a cookie or user preference. Avoid ad-hoc `Time.zone` overrides outside the wrapper.

### Routes

Prefer `scope module:` for namespaced controllers (`resources :items { scope module: :items { resource :pin } }`). Use singular `resource` for one-per-user pages. Intent-style sub-resources (pin, archive, collect) map cleanly to small controllers.

App route table: `AGENTS.md` → Routes.

### SQLite + Solid adapters

One SQLite file per database role (`primary`, `cache`, `queue`, `cable` in `config/database.yml`). Solid Queue can run inside Puma (`SOLID_QUEUE_IN_PUMA`). No separate Redis process.

Trade-off: no Postgres-specific features (advanced full-text, JSONB operators, advisory locks).

### Testing

Minitest + fixtures; parallel by default (`bin/rails test`). System tests via Capybara + Selenium (`bin/rails test:system`).

Reference: Fizzy `test/`.

## When Rails / this stack is a poor fit

- High-volume pub/sub fanout — Solid Cable is fine for modest scale; beyond that, use a dedicated broker.
- Postgres-only features while staying on SQLite.
- Very high job throughput — Solid Queue suits typical app load; heavy pipelines need a dedicated queue.
- Rich client-side application state — Hotwire covers most server-rendered UX; a SPA framework is warranted only when the UI genuinely needs it.
